			<h1 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-6">Terms & Conditions</h1>

			{/* Introduction */}
			<section className="mb-8">
				<p>
					By engaging with NextWave Web Studio (“NextWave,” “we,”
					“our,” or “us”), the client (“you”) agrees to the following
					terms and conditions. These terms are designed to ensure
					clarity, fairness, and accountability for both parties
					across all services provided.
				</p>
			</section>

			{/* Scope of Work & Revisions */}
			<section className="mb-8">
				<h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">
					Scope of Work & Revisions
				</h2>
				<p>
					Each project phase includes up to two (2) reasonable rounds
					of revisions. Any additional revisions or requests beyond
					the original project scope will be treated as new work and
					may require a new agreement, adjusted timelines, or
					additional fees.
				</p>
			</section>

			{/* Client Responsibilities */}
			<section className="mb-8">
				<h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">
					Client Responsibilities
				</h2>
				<p>
					Clients must provide all required deliverables (content,
					access, brand materials, product information, etc.) by the
					date specified in the agreement. For every one (1) day
					client deliverables are late, an additional seven (7) days
					will be automatically added to the delivery schedule.
				</p>
				<p>
					Clients are also responsible for timely approvals, feedback,
					and account access. Delays caused by client inaction will
					extend project timelines without penalty to NextWave.
				</p>
			</section>

			{/* Third-Party Services */}
			<section className="mb-8">
				<h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">
					Third-Party Services
				</h2>
				<p>
					NextWave Web Studio may integrate or configure third-party
					tools (including but not limited to hosting, domains,
					analytics, automation platforms, and marketing software).
					Clients remain responsible for all third-party subscription
					fees, terms, and policies—whether these accounts are housed
					under NextWave or managed directly by the client. NextWave
					is not liable for interruptions, policy changes, or failures
					of third-party providers.
				</p>
			</section>

			{/* Ongoing Retainer Services */}
			<section className="mb-8">
				<h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">
					Ongoing Retainer Services
				</h2>
				<p>
					Services such as automations, marketing campaigns, and
					ongoing maintenance are billed as monthly retainers. Billing
					begins on the service start date. If services begin
					mid-month, the first invoice will be prorated based on the
					number of calendar days remaining in that month. (Example:
					price ÷ days in month × days remaining).
				</p>
			</section>

			{/* Guarantees */}
			<section className="mb-8">
				<h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Guarantees</h2>
				<ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">

			{/* Intellectual Property */}
			<section className="mb-8">
				<h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">
					Intellectual Property & Marketing Rights
				</h2>
				<p>
					Clients receive ownership of final deliverables after full
					payment. However, NextWave retains the right to reuse
					frameworks, code snippets, and internal processes developed
					during the project across other engagements.
				</p>
				<p>
					All clients are considered case study clients. By engaging
					with NextWave, you grant permission for NextWave to showcase
					project details, outcomes, and creative work in full for
					case study purposes.
				</p>
				<p>
					NextWave will include a small trademark attribution such as
					“Powered by NextWave” on all final deliverables (e.g.,
					websites, dashboards, automations). Engagement with NextWave
					signifies consent to this attribution.
				</p>
			</section>

			{/* Termination */}
			<section className="mb-8">
				<h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Termination</h2>
				<p>
					Clients may terminate any ongoing project at any time.
					Completed project phases are non-refundable. If a client
					becomes abusive, unresponsive, fails to provide deliverables
					for thirty (30) consecutive days, or fails to make payment,
					NextWave reserves the right to terminate the project. In
					such cases, the client forfeits rights to the project and no
					refunds will be issued.
				</p>

			{/* Performance Disclaimer */}
			<section className="mb-8">

					Performance Disclaimer
				</h2>
				<p>
					While NextWave Web Studio strives to deliver high-quality
					services, we cannot guarantee specific business outcomes
					such as revenue, traffic, or customer growth. Results may
					vary based on factors beyond our control, including market
					conditions, client execution, and product-market fit.

			</section>

			{/* Force Majeure */}
			<section className="mb-8">
				<h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Force Majeure</h2>
				<p>
					NextWave Web Studio is not liable for delays or failures
					caused by events beyond our reasonable control, including
					but not limited to natural disasters, power outages,
					internet disruptions, third-party service interruptions, or
