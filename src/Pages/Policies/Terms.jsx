			<h1 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-6">Terms & Conditions</h1>

			{/* Introduction */}
			<section className="mb-8">
				<p>
					By engaging with NextWave Web Studio (“NextWave,” “we,”
					“our,” or “us”), the client (“you”) agrees to the following
					terms and conditions. These terms are designed to ensure
					clarity, fairness, and accountability for both parties
					across all services provided.
				</p>
			</section>

			{/* Scope of Work & Revisions */}
			<section className="mb-8">
				<h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">
					Scope of Work & Revisions
				</h2>
				<p>
					Each project phase includes up to two (2) reasonable rounds
					of revisions. Any additional revisions or requests beyond
					the original project scope will be treated as new work and
					may require a new agreement, adjusted timelines, or
					additional fees.
				</p>
			</section>

			{/* Client Responsibilities */}
			<section className="mb-8">
				<h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">
					Client Responsibilities
				</h2>
				<p>
					Clients must provide all required deliverables (content,
					access, brand materials, product information, etc.) by the
					date specified in the agreement. For every one (1) day
					client deliverables are late, an additional seven (7) days
					will be automatically added to the delivery schedule.
				</p>
				<p>
					Clients are also responsible for timely approvals, feedback,
					and account access. Delays caused by client inaction will
					extend project timelines without penalty to NextWave.
				</p>
			</section>

			{/* Third-Party Services */}
			<section className="mb-8">
				<h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">
					Third-Party Services
				</h2>
				<p>
					NextWave Web Studio may integrate or configure third-party
					tools (including but not limited to hosting, domains,
					analytics, automation platforms, and marketing software).
					Clients remain responsible for all third-party subscription
					fees, terms, and policies—whether these accounts are housed
					under NextWave or managed directly by the client. NextWave
					is not liable for interruptions, policy changes, or failures
					of third-party providers.
				</p>
			</section>

			{/* Ongoing Retainer Services */}
			<section className="mb-8">
				<h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">
					Ongoing Retainer Services
				</h2>
				<p>
					Services such as automations, marketing campaigns, and
					ongoing maintenance are billed as monthly retainers. Billing
					begins on the service start date. If services begin
					mid-month, the first invoice will be prorated based on the
					number of calendar days remaining in that month. (Example:
					price ÷ days in month × days remaining).
				</p>
			</section>

			{/* Payment Terms */}
			<section className="mb-8">
				<h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Payment Terms</h2>
				<p>
					For fixed-scope project engagements, fifty percent (50%) of
					the total project fee is due prior to commencement of work.
					The remaining fifty percent (50%) is due prior to the start
					of the second half of the project, unless otherwise
					specified in a signed agreement.
				</p>
				<p>
					For ongoing or retainer-based services, invoices are due
					according to the agreed billing cycle. If payment is not
					received by the due date, all services will be immediately
					paused until payment is made in full. NextWave Web Studio is
					not responsible for project delays, service interruptions,
					or missed deadlines resulting from late or unpaid invoices.
				</p>
			</section>

						{/* Refunds */}
						<section className="mb-8">
				<h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Refunds</h2>
				<p>
					Unless otherwise stated in a signed agreement, all payments
					are non-refundable once work has commenced. If a client
					terminates a project after work has begun, any refund (if
					applicable) will be limited to the unused portion of fees
					paid for work not yet performed.
				</p>
				<p>
					For fixed-scope projects that are structured in phases or
					milestones, fees associated with completed phases are
					non-refundable. If a phase has started, the client remains
					responsible for all work performed and costs incurred up to
					the termination date, and any refundable amount will be
					calculated accordingly.
				</p>
				<p>
					The seventy-two (72) hour money-back guarantee applies only
					if the client cancels within that window. If work has already
					commenced within the guarantee window at the client’s request
					(e.g., expedited start), NextWave may deduct the value of work
					performed prior to cancellation from any refund.
				</p>
			</section>

			{/* Guarantees */}
			<section className="mb-8">
				<h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Guarantees</h2>
				<ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
					<li>
						<strong>100% Money-Back Guarantee:</strong> Clients may
						cancel within seventy-two (72) hours of signing the
						agreement for a full refund.

						references to “ROI” or performance improvements refer
						exclusively to non-financial, operational, or experiential
						metrics, which may include but are not limited to:
						workflow efficiency, automation effectiveness, website
						performance or usability, lead handling processes,
						customer experience improvements, and internal operational
						clarity. ROI guarantees apply only to businesses that are
						already operational, revenue-generating, and demonstrably
						self-sufficient prior to engagement. Startups, pre-revenue
						businesses, or early-stage ventures do not qualify for ROI
						guarantees. All qualifying benchmarks must be defined in
						writing and mutually agreed upon prior to project
						commencement. Benchmarks not explicitly documented shall
						not be implied or assumed. NextWave Web Studio does not
						guarantee revenue growth, profit increases, customer
						acquisition numbers, traffic, rankings, or market
						performance.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Data Privacy Guarantee:</strong> NextWave treats
						all client data with strict confidentiality. Confidential
						information includes non-public business, technical, or
						customer information shared with NextWave in connection
						with the services, unless the information is publicly
						available through no fault of NextWave. NextWave will not
						disclose confidential information outside the scope of the
						project without the client’s consent, except as required
						by law.

					Intellectual Property & Marketing Rights
				</h2>
				<p>
					Clients receive ownership of final deliverables after full
					payment. However, NextWave retains the right to reuse
					frameworks, code snippets, and internal processes developed
					during the project across other engagements.
				</p>
				<p>
					All clients are considered case study clients. By engaging
					with NextWave, you grant permission for NextWave to showcase
					project details, outcomes, and creative work in full for
					case study purposes, unless otherwise agreed in writing.
				</p>
				<p>
					NextWave will include a small trademark attribution such as
					“Powered by NextWave” on all final deliverables (e.g.,
					websites, dashboards, automations), unless otherwise agreed
					in writing. Engagement with NextWave signifies consent to
					this attribution.

			{/* Limitation of Liability */}
			<section className="mb-8">
				<h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">
					Limitation of Liability
				</h2>

					To the maximum extent permitted by law, NextWave Web Studio
					shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental,
					consequential, special, or punitive damages, including but
					not limited to loss of profits, loss of revenue, loss of
					data, or business interruption, arising out of or related to
					any services provided.
				</p>
				<p>
					In no event shall NextWave Web Studio’s total liability
					exceed the total amount of fees actually paid by the client
					to NextWave for the specific services giving rise to the
					claim.

			</section>

			{/* Termination */}
			<section className="mb-8">
				<h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Termination</h2>
				<p>
					Clients may terminate any ongoing project at any time.
					Completed project phases are non-refundable. If a client
					becomes abusive, unresponsive, fails to provide deliverables
					for thirty (30) consecutive days, or fails to make payment,
					NextWave reserves the right to terminate the project. In
					such cases, the client forfeits rights to the project and no
					refunds will be issued.
				</p>

				<h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">
					Performance Disclaimer
				</h2>
				<p>
					While NextWave Web Studio strives to deliver high-quality
					services, we cannot guarantee specific business outcomes
					such as revenue, traffic, rankings, or customer growth.
					Results may vary based on factors beyond our control,
					including market conditions, client execution, and
					product-market fit.
