Hey there. If you're here, it probably means you're curious about how your Google business profile is performing.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.500
And that's awesome because your GBP is one of the most important tools for getting more eyes on your business

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.000
and driving customers through your door or to your website. So here's the thing.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Your Google business profile isn't just a listing. It's the first impression a lot of your potential customers will have.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Rather than searching for your services, looking for your location, or comparing you with your competitors,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
your GBP plays a huge role in whether they decide to choose you.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
But not every profile is set up to work as hard as it could. There might be missing information,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
outdated photos, or missed opportunities to rank higher in your local searches. That's where Next Wave comes in.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
When you request your free audit, I'll take a deep dive into your profile and find out what's working,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
what's not, and what you can do to improve. I'll check things like how your business appears in search,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
whether your information is accurate, and if your profile is fully optimized to bring in more leads.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
And don't worry, I keep things simple and actionable.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
You'll walk away with clear steps on how to improve your online visibility.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
All I need to get started is your email and your website. It's super quick and easy to share.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
So if you're ready to unlock the full potential of your Google business profile,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
